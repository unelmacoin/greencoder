## ðŸŒ± Why Green Coder?

As developers, we write code that runs on millions of devices worldwide, consuming significant amounts of energy. Green Coder helps you understand and reduce your code's environmental impact by identifying inefficient patterns and suggesting optimizations.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: Get instant feedback on your code's sustainability as you type
- **Multi-language Support**: Currently supports JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python (with more languages coming soon)
- **Smart Suggestions**: Get actionable suggestions to improve your code's efficiency
- **Green Score**: See an overall sustainability score for your code
- **Performance Metrics**: Understand your code's CPU and memory usage impact
- **Carbon Footprint Estimation**: Get an estimate of your code's carbon footprint

## Installation

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Code Sustainability Optimizer"
4. Click Install
5. Reload VS Code when prompted

## Usage

The extension runs automatically when you open a supported file. You'll see a status bar item showing your current file's "Green Score".

### Commands

- **Analyze Current File for Sustainability**: Manually analyze the current file
- **Analyze Workspace for Sustainability**: Analyze all supported files in the workspace

## Supported Languages

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Python

## Configuration

The following settings are available:

- `codeSustainabilityOptimizer.enableRealTimeAnalysis`: Enable/disable real-time analysis (default: true)
- `codeSustainabilityOptimizer.analysisLevel`: Set the analysis level ("basic", "standard", or "advanced") (default: "standard")

## How It Works

The extension analyzes your code for common performance and efficiency issues that can impact energy consumption. It provides:

1. **Code Analysis**: Identifies inefficient patterns and potential optimizations
2. **Performance Metrics**: Estimates CPU and memory usage
3. **Carbon Footprint**: Provides an estimate of the environmental impact
4. **Actionable Suggestions**: Offers specific recommendations to improve your code
